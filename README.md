🛠️ Fix the Missing Font

After running the script, you'll have two options for installing a font patched to support icons in PowerShell:
1) You will find a downloaded cove.zip file in the folder you executed the script from. Follow these steps to install the patched Caskaydia Cove nerd font family:

    Extract the cove.zip file.
    Locate and install the nerd fonts.

2) With oh-my-posh (loaded automatically through the PowerShell profile script hosted on this repo):

    Run the command oh-my-posh font install
    A list of Nerd Fonts will appear like so:

PS> oh-my-posh font install

   Select font

  > 0xProto
    3270
    Agave
    AnonymousPro
    Arimo
    AurulentSansMono
    BigBlueTerminal
    BitstreamVeraSansMono

    •••••••••
    ↑/k up • ↓/j down • q quit • ? more

    With the up/down arrow keys, select the font you would like to install and press ENTER
    DONE!

Customize this profile

Do not make any changes to the Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 file, since it's hashed and automatically overwritten by any commits to this repository.

After the profile is installed and active, run the Edit-Profile function to create a separate profile file for your current user. Make any changes and customizations in this new file named profile.ps1.

Now, enjoy your enhanced and stylish PowerShell experience! 🚀
